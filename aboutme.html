<h1>About Me as a Person</h1>
<h2>An driven, open-minded person who loves to explore and engage with the world</h2>
<p>Hi, there! I'm Karen Wu, and I'm from the central area of New Jersey. I'm from a community where I explore different fields of study and hone my abilities.
    I graduated from East Brunswick High School, and now, I'm a Business and Information Systems major at N.J.I.T. Throughout my life,
    I've always had many passions and pursued different fields of study.</p>
<h4>Languages</h4>
<p>I've always loved to study languages.
    My main language is English. However, I'm Chinese-American; I've had
    many opportunities to learn the Chinese language, so I can speak moderately fluent Chinese. I also can speak small amounts of Spanish, due
    to.</p>
    <p>I was passionate about medicine; in high school, I was on the executive board for
the Pre-Med club, organizing events and seminars that helped students pursue careers in the medical field.
Since I believed in maintaining my body and health, I also often participated in sports and played for the E.B.H.S. Girls' Golf team.</p>
<p>I loved to contribute to the community, as I did over 200 hours of volunteer work</p>
